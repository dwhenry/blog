# Why are you trolling me at work?

When you work in the public sector tor you quite often find your github history can be a little sparse. 
Especially if a new employer is using that history to determine your quality as a coder.

On the flip side, if your code is open source and everyone can see it, that means everyone can judge
what you had done. It means every commit could potentially be the difference when applying for your next to job.

So when a friend recently asked me:

> Why are you trolling me at work?

My response is simple: "I’m not. I’m just help you get that next job", and hoping that my friends will do 
the same for me
