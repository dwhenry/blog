# Why are you trolling me at work?

If you work in the private sector and only rarely work on your personal projects it can be quite easy to find your Github commit history being a little sparse.  This can be troublesome, especially when your next potential employer is using that history to determine your quality as a coder.

On the flip side, if your code is open source and everyone can see it, that means everyone can judge how you code, how you have coded in the past and more worryingly how you coded on that little side project you thought no-one cared about. It means every commit could potentially be the difference when applying for your next job.

So when a friend recently asked - after I had commented on some code they had written in the public domain:

> "Why are you trolling me at work?"

My response is simple: "I’m not trolling you. I’m trying to help you get that next job", and hoping that my friends will do the same for me
