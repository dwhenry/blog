# Remembering to do

It is very easy to be lazy. To just pass through the days as the come.

What is difficult is finding the motivation to do. By do I mean getting up and getting 
motivated, from learning something new, to stretching yourself at your job, from starting
a new hobby, to completing that old project that's been sitting in the shed.

All of these things are difficult and this is true if use are so used to your daily routine
that you can almost complete the day while asleep or your days are so long and filled up that
you are too tired to do anything but sleep.

Hopefully this post will help me find the motivation to work on at least one of the side projects
I have started over the years. 

And you never know maybe one day I'll look back on this and be inspired again, as that is the 
case with effort, you have to keep working at it.
