I'm one, are you?

Freeby trolls rule the world. I should know I been one since
the day I had an idea.

It can be as simple as borrowing your mates laptop to watch porn,
all the way up to working out the best (free) hosting stragegy for
your webste.

And While I'll be the first to admit fee shite is good, I understand
that we all need to make a living. And sometimes the easy justification
that we are only stealliing from the rich, well it just doesn't hold.

After all a lot of the current day rich were just a simple developer
before that fist great idea.

So the question I need to ask youself each time I signup for free software
is:

* Does this add value that woud cost me money otherwise?
* If I did if myself, would it be as good?
* Can I make money by using this code in my application? (maybe the most
important)

And if the answer is yes to one or more, then why not pay to take advantage
of someone elses time and effort.
