# So I have and idea but no design

I worked at my previous role for 11 months and when I look back I don't see a raft of major achievements. Instead I see a steady stream of BAU and increamental improvements to the system.

Work that I know had value and benefitted the company, but not page turners by an stretch of the imagination. 

So why am I thinking about this? Well as  Having just finished interviewing for my next job I find it curious when people  It is to do with my resume I have just needed to update my resume as it i once again extension time, and while I am staying in my current role (for now) I did have some trouble finding ground breaking achivements to add to my resume.

So to the point of this post, is it enough to be valuable within the role, or do you need to have achived something epic, to have built the bees knees of computer code. More to the point, what does my next emplyer most want to see? That I can work solidly to ensure tasks are completed or that I can fill out my resume with buzz words?

Unfortunately I think employers secretly love the buzz words. Hopefully most of them realise that incremental improvement is the way forward, because otherwise I in some trouble.
