# Fe Fi Fo Fum



I recently had to make some small changes to a PDF generation process - using prince XML - basically reposiiton the address
on the page and add page numbers, nothing to difficult.

However during testing parts of the document where not being printed. The appeared correctly in the generated PDF,
they just didn't make it to the printer. Added to that locally everything had worked as expected - I had even printed
several pages to ensure it all lined up as required.
