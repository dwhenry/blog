Where does the time go?

I have recently started a new personal project, and as is the case with all new projects I am super keen and willing to spend all me free (i.e. none work) time on it, with the aim for getting it far enough along to be of value.

This means I am actively avoiding drinking, socialising (not much of that anyway) and any otehr activities that might take away my free time.

Lately however I have found myself to be quite streatched and feel like the thing I need to drop is my new project. I know that if I do this I can almost guarentee that I wont pick it up again, and that cutting back the time I spend working on it is basically the same as giving up.

My plan is to keep up the effort, I have a alpha release goal, though I find I add more things that I mark as complete because, well problems come up. But the feeling of success when I hit the target will be worth it, and you never know this might be the idea which allows me to give up my day job. :)
