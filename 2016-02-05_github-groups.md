# Github groups

I recently noticed that my GitHub account had almost 50 repositories, many of which contained old, obsolete or just plain bad code. As a result, I was having trouble identifying what was important and relevant, and given that many companies treat your GitHub account as another check of your suitability during the recruitment process, I was frankly shocked that anyone has ever been willing to hire me.

The fix was extremely simple, I created some additional organisations which I would then use to group my repositories together. Keeping my main account for the most up to date and relevant code, the stuff I wanted potential employers to look at.

* **dwhenry** - my main account.
* **dwhenry-archive** - for older code that I was no longer actively interested in/working on.
* **dwhenry-code-tests** - for code tests I had completed as part of job applications.

Ideal GitHub will eventually implement folders, this would allow code organisation without needing to change the code URL, but until then this is a quick and simple alternative.
