# Github groups

I recently noticied that my github account had almost 50 repositories, many of which I don't remember. In fact there was so much noice it was getting hard for me to find the projects I was looking for.

Given that many companies treat your github account as another check during the recuritment process I was frankly shocked that anyone has ever been willing to hire me.

The fix however was extremely simple. I simply create some additional organisations which I would then use to group my repositories together. 


This would leave my main account with the most relevant and up todate code examples, the stuff I wanted potential employers to look at.

Ideal github will eventually implement folders so that you can better organise your code, but until then this is a quick and simple alternative.

------------

My github accounts/organisations:

* **dwhenry** - my main account.
* **dwhenry-archive** - for older code that I was no longer actively interested in/working on.
* **dwhenry-code-tests** - for code tests I had completed as part of job applications.
