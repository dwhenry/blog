# A little change

I have just staerted working for the Treasury. It's a great location in Victoria right next to Westminter Station.

Unfortunately that is about to change, as once again I feel the pull of Southwark bridge.

Why is this worth mentioning, well I will have moved at most 60 meters down the road from my last employer.

So do I care? Not a great deal, made some great friends at the last job - thats how I got the current role - and hopefully lost more where I am. 

Still a new location would have been nice, not to worry the new friends and collegues will be happy for me to run/play with the old. 

After all life is an adventure.
