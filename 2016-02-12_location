# A little change

I have just started working for the Treasury. It's a great location in Victoria right next to Westminter Station.

Unfortunately, that is about to change as once again I feel the pull of Southwark bridge.

Why is this worth mentioning? It means that I will be moving at most 60 meters down the road from my last employer.

Do I care? Not a great deal, I made some great friends at the last job - thats how I got the current role - and hopefully lots more where I am. 

Still a new location would have been nice, not to worry, the new friends and collegues will be happy for me to run/play with the old. 

After all life is an adventure.
