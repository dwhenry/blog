# Is it quite in here?

My office lacks the buzz of people working. To be clear I am not saying that nothing is being done, or even that work is goining slowly.

No what I am missing is the noise of people working collabrately, be it developers pairing over a problem or sales staff on the phone. Instead we have a large office with each person focused on there their work, may with headphones on to avoid distraction.  Sure occassionally people discuss a problem or have a quick laugh with other in the room, but for the most part thsi is not teh case.

As with all new jobs this has been an adjustment - one that for the most part I did not even notice I was making - especially when I have grown used to working in closely with my peers. 

While I find that more time I spend away from pair programming the more of a fan of the constant feedback it provides, the self analysis when coding solo, knowing that peer review is coming can only make me a better programming.
