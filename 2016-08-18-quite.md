# Is it quite in here?

After 6 months of my new office it has just occurred to me what is lacking: the buzz of people working. To be clear I am not saying that nothing is being done, poeple are working hard all around me, I'm working hard.

What is missing is the noise of people working collabrately, be it developers pairing over a problem or sales staff on the phone. Instead we have a large office with each person is focused on solely on their work, many with headphones on to avoid distraction.  Sure occassionally people discuss a problem or have a quick laugh with other in the room, but for the most part the room is quite of human chatter.

As with all new jobs this has been an adjustment - one that for the most part I did not even notice I was making - especially after a number of noisy offices in which I have worked.

While I find that more time I spend away from pair programming the more of a fan of the constant feedback it provides, the self analysis I have learnt to rely on when coding solo, knowing that peer review is coming can only make me a better programming for future roles.
