# Celebrating the little things

I remember when Harry was born, he was our first child and we couldn't have been more proud or happy. He was a normal child for the most part, had trouble latching, but so did our second. We went home the same as most parents, with no idea what we were doing or what to expect.

At first everything was fine, but then he was diagnosed with reflux followed by a milk intolerance, looking back it's hard to know what was true, the only thing for sure was that the doctors didn't know. As he grew, so did our expectations, we had made friends at NCT and each parent was taking it in turns to boast about their childs latest achivements, but it never felt like we had much to say. By 8 months it was clear that Harry was behind, at 11 he had his first seizure, by 12 month we had a diagnosis, FoxG1.

And with that our expectations changed, it went from thoughts of taking him to play his first rugby game, to getting excited by each little achiveement he managed. It meant sharing in his joy, be it the first time he managed to put a bell off his round-about in his mouth (this took 4 months of trying), or his belly giggles whenever I take him on a swing.

Harry is not a normal child, but he does have the ability to brighten the lives of everyone that he meets and for that I think he is as special as they come. :)
